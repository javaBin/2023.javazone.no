00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.700
We will have a presentation of the visual design for Amazon or

43
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.100

44
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.500
 just the visual things so for 2018.

45
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
They talk about the partner tickets. We will

46
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.500
 talk about the stance selection how that works. We will

47
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.600
 review the important dates towards the

48
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.700
 conference and then we'll finish off with a

49
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.300
 Q&A in the end.

50
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.700
all right, so first of all

51
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.500
That was on 2020 trees completely sold

52
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.800
 out to three or four days for for

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.500
 the the open regular tickets

54
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000
 to be sold out. We didn't release

55
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.100
 all that many because we be kept a

56
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.800
 big pool for you guys. So so we have a lot of tickets available

57
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.600
 for you, but we

58
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 do have a waiting list for both the regular tickets and for

59
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.200
 Partnerships. It's been

60
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 a president that I amount of attention and

61
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.500
 and people or

62
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 companies wanting to be partners this year.

63
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.200
 So so we are flabbergasted and really really

64
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.500
 happy with the attention. They're getting ask the

65
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.700
 companies.

66
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.100
Most of the or at least quite a bit of the

67
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 planning and preparation for javasone is done

68
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.400
 during workshops, which we have on Saturdays. Typically.

69
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.800
 We had one on January 21st,

70
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.200
 and we have a new one on the march

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.700
 on March 25th.

72
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.100
So we said it before we will say

73
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700

 is that we are on track. We have lots of talks coming in from

91
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.700

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.800
And I'd like to to tell you

93
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.500

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.600
 tip here get it in now because right

101
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.500
 now there's a much more easy to

102
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.400
 get that attention of Mark and his

103
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 team because there's lots of lots of

104
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.600

105
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.900

106
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.600
You're gonna have javasone for kids again this year. It's on

107
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.400

 September the 3rd.

109
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.600
You have any anyone in your organization which

110
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.500
 are interested in and this and holding our workshop

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.600
 for the kids send an email to us on Java

112
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.800
 song?

113
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.700
All right, so our design we should

114
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.900
 decide for Java. So 2023.

115
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.300
It's the amazing Java song

116
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.400
 Circus scene.

117
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.800
So this is the setup lots

118
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.500
 of fun stuff juggling power

119
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.800
 whatever circus bits

120
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.500
 you can fit into to Spectrum. No,

121
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.200
 there won't be any elephants.

122
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.500
It's not space there and it's not morally right

123
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.300
 for us either so we'll keep it to to to

124
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.700
 people and

125
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700
Yeah, the activities you can get into.

126
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.200
More information on this if you like you can I can

127
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.900
 ask create a little will present it the setup here

128
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.100
 for for the backdrops in your stance. You can

129
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.400
 just use this if you like to and maximum will be

130
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.400
 helpful a little bit with providing you with a details

131
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.200
 on on

132
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.300
Pictures and what you need to to get

133
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.600
 it working?

134
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.100
So these are then slogans.

135
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.100
Yeah, be creative have some fun and engaging stance Embrace

136
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.900
 inclusivity and diversity and

137
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.200
 enthusiasm and

138
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.100
 being engaged me. So all those things are

139
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100
 what we like to you to do on the understands. That's what we like

140
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.300
 the speakers to do when they're doing their speaks. That's what we in.

141
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.300
 Jobin is gonna be doing towards you guys, hopefully

142
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.700
So that's the the gift of jealous on

143
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.300
 2023.

144
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.700
All right, so down to the to the details partner tickets,

145
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.300
 like I told you earlier

146
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.500
 we are all sold out of regular tickets. That's a lot

147
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.400
 due to the fact that most of

148
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.400
 tickets are then in a pool for you guys.

149
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.700
The speakers will get free tickets. There are

150
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.200
 four flexible tickets per partner for stand

151
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.600
 management. Those tickets

152
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.400
 are intended for for keeping the

153
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.900
 stand amount at all times. They're not

154
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.800
 intended for for participating in in the talks.

155
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:21.900
 So

156
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.600
We ask you to to adhere to

157
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.000
 the center because we haven't taken this

158
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.000
 this tickets are not in sort of in the account

159
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.600
 towards how full the presentation rooms

160
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.500
 will be. So it's very very nice. If you can keep those tickets

161
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.400
 just to to the sound personal but they're

162
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.200
 flexible. So so you can jiggle them

163
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.400
 around your your employees during the conference to

164
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.300
 to ensure that you are able to keep people

165
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.400
 on your stand at all times.

166
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.500
Um, we will open the year registration for for tickets. Now,

167
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.700
 it's open already. You can use the

168
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.300
 form under there. I'll send this to

169
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.100
 you afterwards. So we don't have to to write it down right now. It's nasty URL.

170
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.300
 So that's probably easier for

171
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.400
 us to share it with you on on email after

172
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400
 the meeting.

173
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.400
We never had this many partners like we have today so so

174
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.800
The we call it registration for Ticket applications

175
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.100
 this year. We will collect your your

176
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.500
 applications until the

177
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
 May the 15th, and if

178
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.400
If you are want more tickets than we are able to accommodate we

179
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.500
 have to to set a cap.

180
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.000
On how many tickets we can

181
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.600
 give out per partner?

182
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.400
So how this works is that if we if you have a demand

183
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.400
 for for more tickets, it's you're gonna figure

184
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.200
 out how what's the maximum number? I'll take it

185
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.900
 for a partner is

186
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.300
No, but this deadline is

187
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.100
 before it used to be. Yeah, it's an early deadline.

188
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:10.300
We need this because after listed

189
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.500
 on

190
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.000
 us passed and we have gotten the tickets located to

191
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.300
 you guys. We will we will

192
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.200
 release any remaining tickets to the General

193
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.600
 Public.

194
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.100
because

195
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.300
there are a lot of companies which have

196
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.400
 really wanted to be partners this year but was

197
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.500
 too late so they're waiting list for partnership and a lot of those have

198
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.000
 been dipping. Yeah ticket requests. Also,

199
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.200
 they are on the on the patients for

200
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.700
 for the sort of outside partner tickets. So we are

201
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.200
 going to be sold out totally this year. So we

202
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.400
 want to to get this

203
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.500
 done get its sorted as soon as us as

204
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:53.900
 possible.

205
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.800
So yeah, get your your applications

206
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.200
 in as soon as possible.

207
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.600
We have a question here is the price per

208
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.300
 ticket 7190 for

209
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.300
 all tickets. If you buy 50 one or is the

210
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.700
 first ticket for the lowest price and the others for the

211
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.300
 seven five Nifty five seven five and 90

212
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.400
 and 7390. Yeah, and the

213
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.500
 answer is that if you buy 51 tickets

214
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.400
 all the tickets will cost seven. Well

215
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 one night.

216
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.400
So yes, it's a cheaper to buy a

217
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.500
 51 than 50.

218
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.100
All right

219
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.700
 moving on stand selection.

220
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.800
Iraq after Easter maximum is gonna be contracting

221
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.100
 each and one of you just like

222
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.300
 the stance it will be done in drawer same

223
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.900
 order that we allocated us partners.

224
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.400
 It's being started the

225
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.100
 partners which was registered before January

226
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.400
 6 have been placed in random order and

227
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.200
 the partners after six have been

228
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.800
 ordered by the registration date.

229
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.000
You have to have paid invoice before

230
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.500
 we will allocate the stand to you. So if

231
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.900
 we pass the week of April 10th,

232
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.200
 and you are not paid your inverse, you will be placed

233
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.800
 on the bottom of the list.

234
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.600
And we will not allocate any sound before it was

235
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.900
 has been been paid.

236
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.900
The South selection uses seven software by maximum. It's

237
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.300
 yeah.

238
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.700
Most of you have been doing this before it's the same system, I guess.

239
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.800
This is a surprise. So yeah, yeah. Okay.

240
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.700
 So from the sideline here, this is

241
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.700
 the Expo layout for for

242
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.200
 this year. We've made

243
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.200
 for you. We've made only six

244
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.400
 square meters stance available in

245
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.000
 the middle.

246
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.300
So you can see all the squares are divided into

247
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.400
 four four stands that are

248
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.000
 six square meters in total. So for

249
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.300
 you guys when you are going to

250
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.400
 choose your stand location, this will be we

251
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.300
 will send this sketch out and it will be numbered so

252
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.500
 that you can choose your top three choices before

253
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.400
 we move along to the next partners.

254
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.400
So, please note if you have Wall design

255
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.600
 on stock with us that you

256
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.200
 choose your left or right hand

257
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.200
 side side wall correctly as you choose

258
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.700
 your standard location. We will also help you and provide

259
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.300
 mock-ups of your stand from

260
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.300
 2022 or earlier if we

261
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.200
 have that on stock.

262
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.400
So the difference now from from

263
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.500
 previous years is that

264
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.800
 we have taken the restaurant stand

265
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.400
 areas.

266
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.700
And divided them more so you

267
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.400
 actually get more of a partner area to play

268
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.600
 with then you have previously so as

269
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 you can see at the bottom of the sketch,

270
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.400
 there are three restaurants marked. So

271
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.300
 the the small L is

272
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.100
 the actual serving desks for

273
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.000
 the restaurant where we put the food and on

274
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.500
 the to the right of those stands. The

275
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.500
 gray area is actually your partner area.

276
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.800
Which is bigger than previous years. The seating

277
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.600
 has been taken out of the partner area.

278
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.300
So you won't have to juggle between seats and

279
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.000
 and messy tables as people move

280
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.000
 into your stand.

281
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.100
So it's a bigger space for you to play with.

282
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.900
And and to put furniture and games and Circus theme

283
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.100
 the competitions and funds

284
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.000
 and and games.

285
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.400
We will also provide the

286
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.700
 restaurants that partners with all relevant information

287
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.400
 before you choose your stand location.

288
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.400
So if you have any questions, just feel free to contact us.

289
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.100
Yeah, and

290
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.000
we have only three types of stance. So

291
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.600
 to speak we have the standard stance the concept

292
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.200
 stands and the restaurant stands but in

293
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.300
 standard stance we have included The West Wing

294
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.500
 stance which are the four stands on

295
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.200
 the on the left side there a little bit more out side

296
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.700
 of the Expo that they are bigger. So I'm

297
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.300
 guessing they are around 10 12 12

298
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.200
 scary images and give you more more space

299
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.100
 for your your Concepts.

300
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800
We will take consideration in

301
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.300
 trying to pull people in there with the

302
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.100
 things like.

303
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.700
popular

304
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.500
foodstuffs popular like coffee

305
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.200
 stance things like this. We will

306
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.400
 do our best to ensure that this traffic also

307
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.200
 on the side the best thing.

308
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.300
stands

309
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.100
and in addition to sort of this downstairs. I don't

310
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.200
 know if you have done this next.

311
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.400
Maybe no and addition to

312
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.000
 to to to the yeah we

313
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.200
 go. Oh, yeah.

314
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.600
In addition to the stance that you can see here on the downstairs.

315
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.000
 There are two stands in the donut. They

316
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.300
 are also considered standard stance. So if you

317
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.900
 have been allocated a standard stamp if standard

318
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.300
 partner package those are

319
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.100
 available for you to choose from there is

320
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.500
 one in each M upstairs. It's

321
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.500
It's very sort of freeform sound. It's

322
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.300
 only we need to adhere to to fire regulations.

323
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.100
 And we need to ensure that that it's

324
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.200
 possible for people to walk past it. That's very good

325
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.200
 flow. But but it's gonna be a lot of traffic going to

326
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.700
 from there and it's going to be potential for

327
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.100
 you guys to have

328
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.700
Whatever kind of concept standard or

329
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.300
 standard standard standing one that I want to do up there.

330
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.400
 It's it's much more more open for your own sort

331
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.800
 of definitions than the more regulated stance

332
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.900
 down in the in the Expo.

333
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.300
So anyone with a standard cast and can

334
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.500
 select either exposed and or or visiting stand

335
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.800
 or don't understand but if you are down near

336
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.600
 the bottom of the list, it's likely that some

337
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.400
 of this options have been then sold

338
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.700
 out before it's your turn.

339
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.200
So so it could you could end up better

340
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.100
 than something else done what you had to have had in mind

341
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.500
 in that case.

342
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.100
All right. We'll move on.

343
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.100
These are important dates towards towards the

344
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.400
 conference the main conference itself. It's

345
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.700
 September 6 to 7th. It's with a

346
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.100
 workshop on the day before and covers on

347
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.200
 kids on the Sunday before the conference.

348
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.200
Google speakers is open now and it will end on

349
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.400
 April 17th applications for

350
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.100
 partner tickets is also open now and I'll end on May

351
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.600
 the 15th and standard location. It will start in

352
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.500
 the week just after Easter. So maybe not

353
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.600
 on the 10th because that's a red day in the calendar.

354
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.300
 But during that week maximum will

355
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.000
 be reaching out to you. Maybe I don't know it takes for one or two

356
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.500
 weeks agree.

357
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.500
But it's gonna we're gonna start them and we'll

358
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.200
 see how long it takes before before we've done it all

359
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.900
 all the partners.

360
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.600
The next partner meeting will be in June hopefully.

361
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.000
Hopefully with the testing of the food. Yes. Yeah, so that's
